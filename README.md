## Get started

Start by adding the package to your dependencies:

```bash
npm i @oceanprotocol/squid
```

The package exposes `Ocean` and `Logger` which you can import in your code like this:

```js
// ES6
import { Ocean, Logger } from '@oceanprotocol/squid'

// ES2015
const { Ocean, Logger } = require('@oceanprotocol/squid')
```

You can then connect to running [Keeper](https://github.com/oceanprotocol/keeper-contracts), [Aquarius](https://github.com/oceanprotocol/aquarius), [Brizo](https://github.com/oceanprotocol/brizo) instances, e.g.:

```js
const ocean: Ocean = await Ocean.getInstance({
    // the node of the blockchain to connect to, could also be infura
    nodeUri: 'http://localhost:8545',
    // the uri of aquarius
    aquariusUri: 'http://localhost:5000',
    // the uri of brizo
    brizoUri: 'http://localhost:8030',
    // address that brizo uses
    brizoAddress: '0x00bd138abd70e2f00903268f3db08f2d25677c9e'
    // the uri to the parity node you want to use for encryption and decryption
    parityUri: 'http://localhost:9545',
    // the uri of the secret store that holds the keys
    secretStoreUri: 'http://localhost:12001'
})
```

For an overview of endpoint configurations making up various Ocean networks, please refer to [`.env.local.example`](https://github.com/oceanprotocol/commons/blob/master/client/.env.local.example) from commons.

### Examples

You can see how `squid-js` is used on:

- [Docs: React Tutorial](https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/tutorials/react-setup/)
- [Integration test](/src/integration/ocean/)
- [Tuna](https://github.com/oceanprotocol/tuna/tree/develop/node)

## Documentation

**[Docs: squid-js API Reference ‚Üí](https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/references/squid-js/)**

Alternatively, you can generate the raw TypeDoc documentation locally by running:

```bash
# will output to ./doc folder
npm run doc
```

### Migration Guide

Instructions on how to migrate between breaking versions:

- [Migration Guide](MIGRATION.md)

## Development

To start development you need to:

```bash
npm i
npm start
```

## Testing

### Unit Tests

For unit tests, running [`ganache-cli`](https://github.com/trufflesuite/ganache-cli) is required before starting the tests. It's best to start it on a different port so it doesn't clash with anything running in Barge:

```bash
npm i -g ganache-cli
ganache-cli --port 18545
export ETH_PORT=18545
```

To start unit tests, run:

```bash
npm test
```

or to watch for changes:

```bash
npm run test:watch
```

to create code coverage information:

```bash
npm run test:cover
```

### Integration Tests

Besides a running `ganache-cli` instance, a locally running Ocean network is required. To do so before running the tests, use [Barge](https://github.com/oceanprotocol/barge):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/oceanprotocol/barge
cd barge

./start_ocean.sh --no-commons
```

In another terminal window, run this script and export the seed phrase:

```bash
# copies the contract artifacts once the local Ocean network is up and running
./scripts/keeper.sh

# export Spree accounts seed phrase
export SEED_WORDS="taxi music thumb unique chat sand crew more leg another off lamp"
```

Once everything is up, run the integration tests:

```bash
npm run integration
```

to generate code coverage information during test, run:

```bash
npm run integration:cover
```

## Code Style

Project follows [eslint-config-oceanprotocol](https://github.com/oceanprotocol/eslint-config-oceanprotocol). For linting and auto-formatting you can use:

```bash
# lint all ts with eslint
npm run lint

# auto format all ts with prettier, taking all configs into account
npm run format
```

## Production build

To create a production build:

```bash
npm run build
```

## Releases

From a clean `master` branch you can run any release task doing the following:

- bumps the project version in `package.json`, `package-lock.json`
- auto-generates and updates the CHANGELOG.md file from commit messages
- creates a Git tag
- commits and pushes everything
- creates a GitHub release with commit messages as description
- Git tag push will trigger Travis to do a npm release

You can execute the script using arguments to bump the version accordingly:

- To bump a patch version: `npm run release`
- To bump a minor version: `npm run release minor`
- To bump a major version: `npm run release major`

For the GitHub releases steps a GitHub personal access token, exported as `GITHUB_TOKEN` is required. [Setup](https://github.com/release-it/release-it#github-releases)
